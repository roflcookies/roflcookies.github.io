3. Set aside the black cap and rubber gasket.
4. Ensure the inner chimney is firmly in place before continuing.

### 02. Filling

If using sweeter juices, taking a moment to wick out the residual juice with some toilet paper or papertowel can extend the lifespan of pods.

1. Fill juice up to line
2. **Very lightly** squeeze pod while replacing the rubber gasket.  This will allow it to sit in the pod without being popped back out from compressing the air in the pod.
3. Replace the cap and blow **hard** into the top of the pod a few times or until juice stops coming out of the bottom.

### Advice

* Do not pry the contacts of the pod up unless you are committed to a broken juul device (1 or both spring loaded contacts stuck in the down position).
* Remove the cotton pads in new-gen juul pods.  They become over saturated before finishing even one fill and only increase the likelihood of juice coming out of the top.
